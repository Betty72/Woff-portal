    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
        At Team Woff, we believe every dog deserves more than just a walk — they deserve companionship, care, and someone their humans can truly trust. 🐾
    </p>

    <p>
        Born from one dog owner’s real struggle to find a reliable walker in a sea of questionable Facebook ads, Team Woff was created to make it easy, safe, and actually enjoyable to find the perfect dog walker.
        Whether you're at work, traveling, or just need a little help keeping your pup active and happy, we’ve got your tail covered.
    </p>

    <p>
        We know Swedes take their trust seriously (and their bread prices even more so 😉), so we've built a platform that puts transparency, warmth, and quality front and center.
        No hidden fees, no surprises — just trustworthy walkers, happy dogs, and tails wagging.
    </p>

    <p>
        Team Woff isn’t just a service — it’s a community. And at the heart of it all is the dog who inspired it: Otis, our CEO and Chief Cuddle Officer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because we’re not just dog people. We’re <em>your</em> kind of dog people. 💚
