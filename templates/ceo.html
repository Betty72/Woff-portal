    <p>
        Introducing the heartbeat of Team Woff: <strong>Otis</strong> – our CEO, Head of Cuddles, and Supreme Commander of Snacks.
    </p>

    <p>
        Otis isn’t just the inspiration behind Team Woff — he’s the reason we exist. As a proud Miniature Pinscher with a sharp eye for good people and an even sharper nose for treats, Otis knows exactly what it means to trust someone with your dog.
    </p>

    <p>
        That’s why every walker you’ll find on this platform has been selected with Otis-level standards: trustworthy, kind, and dog-approved.

    <h3>💸 Pricing</h3>

        “I don’t bark much, but when I do… it’s to approve walkers who deserve your trust.” – Otis
